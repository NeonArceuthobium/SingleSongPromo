    <h3>Verse One</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the internet! Have a look around</p>
    <p>Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found</p>
    <p>We've got mountains of content, some better, some worse</p>
    <p>If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="verse">
    <h3>Verse Two</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the internet! Come and take a seat</p>
    <p>Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?</p>
    <p>There's no need to panic; this isn't a test, haha</p>
    <p>Just nod or shake your head, and we'll do the rest</p>

    <h3>Verse Four</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the internet! Put your cares aside</p>
    <p>Here's a tip for straining pasta; here's a nine-year-old who died</p>
    <p>We've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports</p>
    <p>And a bunch of colored-pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other</p>

    <section class="verse">
    <h3>Verse Five</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the internet! Hold on to your socks</p>
    <p>'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock</p>
    <p>They are grainy and off-putting; he just sent you more</p>
    <p>Don't act surprised, you know you like it, you whore</p>

    <h3>Verse Six</h3>
    <p>See a man beheaded, get offended, see a shrink</p>
    <p>Show us pictures of your children, tell us every thought you think</p>
    <p>Start a rumor, buy a broom, or send a death threat to a boomer</p>
    <p>Or DM a girl and groom her, do a Zoom or find a tumor in your—</p>
    <p>Here's a healthy breakfast option, you should kill your mom</p>
    <p>Here's why women never fuck you; here's how you can build a bomb</p>
    <p>Which Power Ranger are you? Take this quirky quiz</p>

    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>Could I interest you in everything all of the time?</p>
    <p>A little bit of everything all of the time?</p>
    <p>Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime</p>
    <p>Anything and everything, all of the time</p>
    <p>Could I interest you in everything all of the time?</p>
    <p>A little bit of everything all of the time?</p>

    <h3>Bridge</h3>
    <p>You know, it wasn't always like this</p>
    <p>Not very long ago, just before your time</p>
    <p>Right before the towers fell, circa '99</p>
    <p>This was catalogs, travel blogs, a chatroom or two</p>
    <p>We set our sights and spent our nights waiting</p>
    <p>For you!</p>
    <p>You, insatiable you</p>
    <p>Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two</p>
    <p>And it did all the things we designed it to do</p>
    <p>Now, look at you! Oh, ha, look at you!</p>
    <p>You, you! Unstoppable, watchable</p>
    <p>Your time is now; your inside's out; honey, how you grew</p>
    <p>And if we stick together, who knows what we'll do?</p>
    <p>It was always the plan to put the world in your hand</p>
